# A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Classification of Eye Diseases using Fundus Images
This project was made under the guidance of my college faculty.

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning approach for the classification of eye diseases(Cataract, Diabetic retinopathy and Gluacoma) using fundus images. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing eye conditions through advanced image analysis techniques.

## Technologies Used
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Image Processing Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab


## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need access to Google Colab. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Open Google Colab:**
   Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   In a new notebook, run the following code to clone the repository:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/eye-disease-classification.git
   %cd eye-disease-classification

1. Install Required Packages:
If there are any additional packages required, you can install them using:

!pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Prepare the Dataset:
Upload your fundus images to the Colab environment or link to a dataset stored in Google Drive.

3. Run the Model Training:
Execute the training script to train the model on the dataset:

!python train_model.py

4. Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new fundus images:

!python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg

**Web Interface**
If you have developed a web interface, you can run it in Colab using Flask. Make sure to follow the specific instructions for running web applications in a Colab environment.
